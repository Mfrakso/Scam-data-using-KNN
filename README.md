# Scam-data-using-KNN
This repository demonstrates the use of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification on two different datasets related to scam data. The project includes steps for loading the data, visualizing the points, and fitting the KNN model. Due to package installation issues, some steps may not be fully executed, but the approach is demonstrated.

## Overview

In this project, I work with two datasets, `scamData1` and `scamData2`, which contain information about potential scam classifications. The goal is to classify the data points into two categories (labeled `0` and `1`) using the KNN algorithm. The project includes the following steps:

1. **Loading the Data**: Data is loaded from CSV files into R.
2. **Visualizing the Data**: Scatter plots are created for each dataset.
3. **Fitting a KNN Model**: A KNN classification model is trained on the data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: KNN predictions are evaluated using summary statistics.
